## Bets and Number Arguments

All of the games in the bot support the same values for bets, as well as the shop and any other command that expects a number as an argument (like /craft).

You can bet using max (or m) to bet your Betting Maximum indicated by /me. You can also buy the maximum number of an item that you can afford, or sell the number of an item that you have using max or m as the count.

If you have less than your betting allowance, it will use all your current cash.

When betting, you can add the following letters after your bet as a shortcut for large numbers.

E.g. 1k = 1,000
y  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
z  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
e  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000
p  = 1,000,000,000,000,000
t  = 1,000,000,000,000
g  = 1,000,000,000
m  = 1,000,000
